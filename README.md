# 🎉 Fun Calculator 🎉

A simple yet entertaining Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations with style! 😎

## 🚀 Features
- **Addition** ➕ (Yay, math!)
- **Subtraction** ➖ (Negative vibes, but necessary!)
- **Multiplication** ✖️ (More bang for your buck!)
- **Division** ➗ (No math disasters, please!)
- **Decimal-friendly** ✨ (Floats welcome!)
- **Emoji-powered** 🎉 (Because why not?)

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. No extra dependencies needed! Just pure Python magic. 🧙‍♂️

## 🎮 Usage
Run the script in your terminal:
```bash
python fun_calculator.py
Then:

Enter your first number (decimals allowed!).

Enter your second number (still no judgment on decimals!).

Watch the calculator do its thing and display all four operations at once! 🎩✨

📝 Code Highlights
Uses float() for decimal support

Clean, commented code with emojis (for maximum fun)

Prints all four operations in one go

⚠️ Important Note
Division by zero will crash this calculator (we trust you won't do that! 😉)

For serious calculations, maybe use something more boring. This one is for fun! 🎊

🎨 Example Output
